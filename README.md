# __SPECTRE__

_pull. transmit. fall in love, and break up again._

SPECTRUM is a curatorial experiment looking into speculative forms of curating using the web as a medium.
It departs from the use of technology to create connections. 
Showing what is shown and not shown in the museum.
- the anti-museum: highlighting objects from a collection that were collected but seem to never been shown on display.
- the xenomorph: _SPECTRE_ is in search properties that are perhaps foreign to classical museum databases and taxonomies. 
- the current: _SPECTRE_ consists of a medium-specific reading that is made possible only through the technology of today. In such it reaches a state of contemporaneity.
- the past-future: _SPECTRE_ invokes the past as a ghost in the present. How does the appearing of these recent pasts inform us in the present.
- the transhistorical: _SPECTRE_ does not depart from a historical reading of the collection. Instead it invokes the in-between relationships of objects across and beyond histories.
