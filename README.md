# __MODELS FROM THE PAST FOR THE FUURE__

_pull. transmit. fall in love, and break up again._

SPECTRUM is a curatorial experiment looking into speculative forms of curating using the web as a medium.
It departs from the use of technology to create connections.

MODELS FROM THE PAST FOR THE FUTURE is a site for speculative and intuitive knowledge production that is both reflective and performative in investigating and embracing the (as yet) unknown. At the moment of closing the museum, this research positions itself in between spaces of where we are now and where we are going next.

    As an evolving platform, it plays out the fluctuating of thoughts and spaces and seeks out alternative approaches and readings of the collection of Design museum Gent.

    As a living archive, it will grow and serve as a sensing layer for past, current and future research practices. Living - permutating borders - the interweave of past traces and future visions.
