# CURATORIAL STATEMENT

*“I then turned my microscope to the cognition engine… This was an engine undergoing continuous transformation,* 
*indeed modifying itself as part of its operations. The lattice was not so much a machine as it was a page on which the machine was written,* 
*and on which the machine itself ceaselessly wrote.” (Chiang, T. , 2019. Exhalation.)*

MODELS FROM THE PAST FOR THE FUTURE is a curatorial experiment and post-digital discourse looking into past, future and speculative models, and takes place during the closure of the Design Museum Ghent (2022-2025); as such this exercise positions itself in a period of transition where past, present and future interlock.
By focusing on the medium-specificity of the web, it investigates new curatorial strategies that better reflect the complexities, intricacies and plural nature of design practice today. As a prototype for an alternative system, it is always critically probing new forms of knowledge production. And in its growth, it is both reflective and performative in nature, as we embrace the (as yet) unknown in its potential. - . “a computing machine for redirecting air currents”.
* as a dynamic network; the project is in constant evolution and critically approaches the underlying metabolism of the museum as a fluid institution. No "rinse and repeat" but a form of "slow programming" that takes time for getting to know itself. Because whoever wants to shape the future, will have to know its past.
* As a living archive; it approaches the past as an asset for the present and the future. A growing organ, which absorbs, processes and discards. The intertwining of traces of the past with visions for the future.

Above all, it eschews the classically oriented forms of -indexation and collection discovery. The collection database may be the starting point of this search, but its finality lies precisely in the critical questioning of the one-to-one translation of its structure in making the collection public.

The COMPUTATIONAL, XENO-MORPHIC, the SENSORIAL & SENSIBLE, the TRANS-HISTORICAL, the CURRENT and PAST-FUTURE are speculative models that instigate us in questioning our current tools and inspire us in devising new kinds of knowledge production and interfaces that are perhaps more sensible to its users, more conscious of its surroundings and above all - foster inspiration. And might guide us in moving from “caring for collections”, towards a collection of care.
