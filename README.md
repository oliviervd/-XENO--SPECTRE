# PROGRAM STUDIOS WEB INTERFACE 
Design Museum Gent develops a sustainable program driven by the activity of five studios. In each Studio, a multidisciplanry team exchanges expertise around a theme and creates multiple forms of output.
By establishing these studios, the museum wishes to commit itself to a more sustainable and caring artistic operation. Each studio functions complementary to both other studios and internal operations.
In terms of content, the studios align with the museum's identity and run over several years as a form of slow programming. Gradually, they build expertise that is then pooled, shared and communicated.
The studio's an evolve, change and converge over time, in relation to social dynamics and themes. And embrace fluidity, complexity and experimentation as both a way of being and praxis.
