# __SPECTRE__

_pull. transmit. fall in love, and break up again._

SPECTRUM is a curatorial experiment looking into speculative forms of selection. 
Showing what is shown and not shown in the museum.
- the anti-museum: highlighting objects from a collection that were collected but seem to never been shown on display.
- the xenomorph: 
- the current
- the past-future. 

an alternative browser for the collection of Design Museum Gent.
