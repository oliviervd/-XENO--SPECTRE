            <p style={{fontSize: "15px"}}> MODELS FROM THE PAST FOR THE FUTURE takes the form of a speculative research into
                alternative approaches and takes on the collection of Design Museum Gent. As an evolving platform it will
                grow and serve as a testing ground for past, current and future research. If anything, it moves and shies
                away from classical approaches of indexing and in opening up museum collections online. It takes the collection database
                as a starting point but remedies the wretch and clutch of its methodologies.
                <br/> <br/> The XENO-MORPHIC, the SENSORIAL, the TRANSHISTORICAL, the CURRENT and PAST-FUTURE are all ideologies
                and perspectives that push us in devicing new kinds of interfaces that are perhaps more sensible to its users,
                more aware of its surroundings and above all - kindle inspiration.
