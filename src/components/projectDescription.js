            <p style={{fontSize: "15px"}}> MODELS FROM THE PAST FOR THE FUTURE takes the form of a speculative research into
                alternative approaches and takes on the collection of Design Museum Gent. As an evolving platform and living archive it will
                grow and serve as a testing ground for past, current and future research. If anything, it moves and shies
                away from classical approaches of indexing and in opening up museum collections online. It takes the collection database
                as a starting point but remedies the wretch and clutch of its methodologies.

                more aware of its surroundings and above all - kindle inspiration.
