                        The social role of the museum consists not only in opening up these new models and design principles but also in acting
                        upon them as a heritage institution in society. If not, we as a museum are in danger of lapsing into a form of facadism
                        in which programming about sustainability is not also sustainable. The latter is a major challenge that prevails internationally.
                        In this sense, making the institution sustainable implies a critical reprogramming of the museum and metabolism as a whole.

                        When we talk about the museum and its metabolism, one of the most important organs remains the collection and its management.
                        However, these actions, often invisible to the public, and the choices made in them also carry consequences. How do we define a caring collection?

                    <br/>
                    <div className="left box" style={{fontSize: "15px", fontFamily: "happy-times-NG_regular_master_web"}}>
                        What if we approach the collection as a book of samples? A catalog from which inspiration can be drawn. But also a form of organization that is indifferent
                        to any form of authorship. Approaching the collection as a form of inspiration rather than a source of information shifts the emphasis from the institutional
                        to the rather human and refers to the early history of the museum.  Can such an approach encourage the desacralization of a museum collection?

                    <div className="left box" style={{fontSize: "15px", fontFamily: "happy-times-NG_regular_master_web"}}>
                        Authorship and visibility often go hand in hand. As a museum, we need to be aware of how we may or may not further perpetuate these dominant forms of authorship.
                        As a counter-proposal and exploratory curatorial model, SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, (re-)negotiates form as a base principle for design, looking beyond the status of
                        recognized authorship and undocumented artifacts. This does not mean to embrace anonymity, nor the wish to negate the role and importance of the designer but
                        rather to establish a mutual relationship and recognition of the other based on scales and values that are more appropriate for our current times
