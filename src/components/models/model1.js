                        For four years this question was central to one of the tracks in Object Stories, the permanent presentation
                        of the collection of Design Museum Gent. The objects on display (within this specific track) all in their
                        own way demonstrated that although there is an increased focus on sustainability and social concern today,
                        this phenomenon is not new in the design world per se. Throughout history, various design strategies have
                        emerged that critically addressed the impact of our actions on the climate and, as a response,
                        defined new production methods and/or formulated alternate forms of society that better correspond to the issues at hand.
                    </div>
                    <br/>
                    <div className="left box" style={{fontSize: "15px", fontFamily: "happy-times-NG_regular_master_web"}}>
                        Marjan van Helvert defined “Responsible Objects” (also the title of the track on responsible design in Object Stories)
                        as objects that behave responsibly, consciously and with care in relation to their <a href="#responsible_objects" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="responsible_objects_ref">environment</a>.
                        Taking responsibility through responsible behavior affects and effects all parts of society and is perhaps the primary precondition in order for something (or someone) to co-exist.
                        Which raises the question how the museum as an institution withing society, can also contribute for the better within this shifting society. Not only by disseminating and opening up these good examples of design,
                        but also by becoming more self-aware and self-conscious by making the critical reflection ourselves of how we can act in a more caring manner.
                        An institution that does not only act about or upon society, but also for and in society.
                        As an interface that engages in a mutual relationship – a form of coexistence that moves beyond the mere display.
                        If not, we risk lapsing into a form of façadism in which programming about <a href="#sustainability_exhibitions" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="sustainability_exhibitions_ref">sustainability</a> is not also sustainable;
                        a major challenge that prevails and is being addressed internationally within the (touring) exhibition <a href="#resource_hungry" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="resource_hungry_ref">sector</a>.
                        In this sense, making the institution sustainable also implies a critical reprogramming of the museum and its <a href="#metabolism" aria-describedby="glossary-label" id="metabolism_ref">metabolism</a> as a whole.

                    <br/>
                    <div className="left box" style={{fontSize: "15px", fontFamily: "happy-times-NG_regular_master_web"}}>
                        <p style={{fontSize: "15px", fontFamily: "P-ACR-AGON-Regular"}}>METABOLISM</p>. What if we tried to alter our metabolism in such a way that the core task of the museum of taking
                        care of the collection (conservation/preservation) is extended to the sensible act of supporting a <u>collection of care</u>?
                        For is not the process of expanding the collection through acquisition essentially a transfer of caring for an object from one person to the other?
                        Let’s take for example the acquisition of the "sample book with paint recipes", a 19th-century catalog of samples that used to belong to the personal library of Henry van de Velde,
                        before it was gifted to the museum. It is possible that this book was used as a source of inspiration
                        when designing one or more of his textile designs. We are now taking care of this object by preserving it,
                        yet it has almost never been on display in the museum, which begs the question, who are we taking care for?
                    </div>
                    <br/>
                    <div className="left box" style={{fontSize: "15px", fontFamily: "happy-times-NG_regular_master_web"}}>
                        <p style={{fontSize: "15px", fontFamily: "P-ACR-AGON-Regular"}}>SOCIAL</p>. How can technology then aid us in rekindling this potentiality, (re-)invoking this idea of being inspired? Can we create a model that
                        establishes speculative relationships between the samples in this book on one hand and the digitized
                        objects in our collection on the other? By means of color extraction, the model tries to evoke a social network,
                        a system, in which objects relate to one another based on their color palette. At the same time,
                        this reorganization of the collection based on samples made and collected by an unknown colorist,
                        evokes a "culture of anonymity" while also seeking other approaches to our collection that move beyond
                        the dominant form of authorship. An inherent quality of the work that often through both its absence and/or presence
                        determines the visibility or invisibility of an object.
                    </div><br/>
                    <div className="left box" style={{fontSize: "15px", fontFamily: "happy-times-NG_regular_master_web"}}>
                        This approach of the collection as a social network, - a speculative system that connects in a transhistorical and transdisciplinary way -
                        transcends the art historical and institutionalized view - resounding the indeterminacy that might lie at the museum’s foundations.
                        At the same time it very much resonates with the "indeterminacy" that might lie at the museum’s foundations, a place where knowledge is constantly being (re-)produced based upon the passage of both human and non-human agency.
                        One could also read this excercise as if revisiting, invoking or emulating the museum in its early, former form, in which it went as a <a href="#models_museum" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="models_museum_ref">model museum</a>;
                        (musee des modeles) a place with the social purpose of inspiring craftsmen by presenting good models or forms of design. Nostalgic, no. Co-existent, perhaps.
