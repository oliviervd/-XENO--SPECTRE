                        For four years this question was central to one of the tracks in Object Stories, the permanent presentation
                        of the collection of Design Museum Gent. The objects on display (within this specific track) all in their
                        own way demonstrated that although there is an increased focus on sustainability and social concern today,
                        this phenomenon is not new in the design world per se. Throughout history, various design strategies have
                        emerged that critically addressed the impact of our actions on the climate and, as a response,
                        defined new production methods and/or formulated alternate forms of society that better correspond to the issues at hand.

                    <div className="left box" style={{fontSize: "15px", fontFamily: "happy-times-NG_regular_master_web"}}>
                        Marjan van Helvert defined “Responsible Objects” (also the title of the track on responsible design in Object Stories)
                        as objects that behave responsibly, consciously and with care in relation to their <a href="#responsible_objects" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="responsible_objects_ref">environment</a>.
                        Taking responsibility through responsible behavior affects and effects all parts of society and is perhaps the primary precondition in order for something (or someone) to co-exist.
                        Which raises the question how the museum as an institution withing society, can also contribute for the better within this shifting society. Not only by disseminating and opening up these good examples of design,
                        but also by becoming more self-aware and self-conscious by making the critical reflection ourselves of how we can act in a more caring manner.
                        An institution that does not only act about or upon society, but also for and in society.
                        As an interface that engages in a mutual relationship – a form of coexistence that moves beyond the mere display.
                        If not, we risk lapsing into a form of façadism in which programming about <a href="#sustainability_exhibitions" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="sustainability_exhibitions_ref">sustainability</a> is not also sustainable;
                        a major challenge that prevails and is being addressed internationally within the (touring) exhibition <a href="#resource_hungry" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="resource_hungry_ref">sector</a>.
                        In this sense, making the institution sustainable also implies a critical reprogramming of the museum and its <a href="#metabolism" aria-describedby="glossary-label" id="metabolism_ref">metabolism</a> as a whole.

                        ways of changing the metabolism of the museum in such a way that core tasks of the museum such as
                        taking care of the collection (conservation/preservation) is reformulated into the sensible act of supporting a  <u>collection of care</u>?
                        Could we not agree that the process of expanding the collection through acquisition is essentially
                        a transfer of “caring for” an object from one person to the other? Defining what is meant by
                        “to take care for”, as well as the transformation of caring for a collection into a collection of
                        care may help us as a museum in our transformation into a sustainable and caring institution.
                        Let’s take for example the acquisition of the "sample book with paint recipes",
                        a 19th-century catalog of samples that used to belong to the personal library of Henry van de Velde,
                        before it was gifted to the museum. It is plausible that this book was used as a source of inspiration
                        by Henry van de Velde when designing one or more of his textile designs. We are now taking care of
                        this object by preserving it, yet it has almost never been on display in the museum, which begs the question,
                        who are we taking care of? And for who are we taking care?
                    </div>

                        <p style={{fontSize: "15px", fontFamily: "P-ACR-AGON-Regular"}}>TO TAKE CARE OF. </p>
                        Taking care of something or someone is a highly social endeavor and is a premise for us to co-exist.
                        To support this act of caretaking we developed technology of all sorts – this same technology however
                        can also lead to direct opposite when not used properly. Could we now imagine interfaces of care?
                        Can we create a model that establishes speculative relationships? For example, to socialize
                        between the samples in this book on one hand and the digitized objects in our collection on the other?
                        One such interface could be achieved by means of color extraction, a model that tries to evoke a social network,
                        a system, in which objects relate to one another based on their color palette. At the same time,
                        this reorganization of the collection based on samples made and collected by an unknown colorist,
                        evokes a "culture of anonymity" while also seeking other approaches to our collection that move
                        beyond the dominant form of authorship. An inherent quality of the work that often determines
                        the visibility and/or invisibility of an object.

                    </div><br/>
                    <div className="left box" style={{fontSize: "15px", fontFamily: "happy-times-NG_regular_master_web"}}>
                        This approach of the collection as a social network, - a speculative system that connects in a transhistorical and transdisciplinary way -
                        transcends the art historical and institutionalized view - resounding the indeterminacy that might lie at the museum’s foundations.
                        At the same time it very much resonates with the "indeterminacy" that might lie at the museum’s foundations, a place where knowledge is constantly being (re-)produced based upon the passage of both human and non-human agency.
                        One could also read this excercise as if revisiting, invoking or emulating the museum in its early, former form, in which it went as a <a href="#models_museum" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="models_museum_ref">model museum</a>;
                        (musee des modeles) a place with the social purpose of inspiring craftsmen by presenting good models or forms of design. Nostalgic, no. Co-existent, perhaps.
