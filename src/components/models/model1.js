                        “When is an object socially or ecologically responsible?” , this question was central to one of the tracks within Object Stories,
                        the permanent collection presentation of the Design Museum Ghent, for 4 years. Although there is an increased focus on sustainability and social concern today -
                        this phenomenon is not new in the design world per se. Throughout history, various design strategies have emerged that critically address the impact of our actions on the climate and,
                        in response, define new production methods and/or forms of society.

                        Marjan van Helvert defined “Responsible Objects” as objects that relate responsibly, consciously and with care to their environment.
                        In line with this, the question arises today how we as an institution can also make our contribution within this shifting society.
                        Not only by disseminating and opening up these good examples of design, but also by making the critical reflection ourselves of how we can act in a more caring manner.
                        An institution that does not only act about society, but also for and in society. If not, we risk lapsing into a form of façadism in which programming about sustainability
                        is not also sustainable. The latter is a major challenge that prevails and is being addressed internationally within the (touring) exhibition sector.
                        In this sense, making the institution sustainable also implies a critical reprogramming of the museum and its metabolism as a whole.

                    <br/>

                        As a museum, the collection obviously remains one of the most prominent and essential organs within the museum's metabolism.
                        How can we move past taking care of our collection, towards a collection of care?
                        The way the museum acquires collection objects is varying, some objects are acquired directly from the designer, others are acquired as gifts,
                        thus already prior belonging to another collection. The latter transaction is characterized by the (intimate) transfer of responsibility and care for a certain object.
                        The latter occurred in the acquisition of the "sample book with paint recipes", a 19th-century catalog of samples that belonged to the personal library of Henry van de Velde.
                        It is possible that this book was used as a source of inspiration when designing one or more of his textile designs.
                        Taking this model, in which one object inspires the other, as our starting point,
                        we are investigating how technology can be used to establish speculative relationships between
                        the samples in this book on one hand and the digitized objects in our collection on the other.
                        By means of color extraction, a speculative network is created in which objects relate to one another based on their color palette.
                        This reorganization of the collection based on samples made and collected by an unknown colorist,
                        evokes a "culture of anonymity" while also seeking other approaches to our collection that move beyond the dominant form of authorship.
                        An inherent quality of the work that often determines the visibility and/or invisibility of an object.

                        This approach of the collection as a social network, - a speculative system that connects in a transhistorical and transdisciplinary way -
                        transcends the art historical and institutionalized view - and also refers to the early history of the museum where it functioned as a model museum;
                        a place with the social purpose of inspiring craftsmen by presenting good models or forms of design.
